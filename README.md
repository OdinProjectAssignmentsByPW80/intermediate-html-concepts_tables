## Assignment

From MDN's [Challenge: Structuring a planet data table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Planet_data_table):

> ###  Project Brief
> You are working at a school; currently your students are studying the planets of our solar system, and you want to provide them with an easy-to-follow set of data to look up facts and figures about the planets. An HTML data table would be ideal â€” you need to take the raw data you have available and turn it into a table.

The challenge provides the following as starting points:

- [blank-template.html &rArr;](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/tables/assessment-start/blank-template.html)
- [minimal-table.css &rArr;](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/tables/assessment-start/minimal-table.css)
- [planets-data.txt &rArr;](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/tables/assessment-start/planets-data.txt)

> [!NOTE]
> The challenge includes a seven step process to follow to completion. As per usual, I will ignore it.
